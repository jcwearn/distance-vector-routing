Description: Distance Vector Routing Simulation
Usage: python dvsimulator.py network_config.txt
Issues:  Due to time constraints I was not able to implement the optional argument --split and --dest
         Additionally I was unable to implement a break in a link during the simulation
         However I do have test code that shows a link can be successfully removed

         Another bug I found is that my firstHop calculation does not work after several iterations
